These instructions are tailored for my own ferris built with elite pi microcontrollers, which require conversion and direct flashing to each side.

put each side of keyboard into boot mode, one at a time. Then, depending on which side is plugged in:

qmk flash -c -kb ferris/sweep_mx_mbuk -km lindoman -e CONVERT_TO=elite_pi -bl uf2-split-left
qmk flash -c -kb ferris/sweep_mx_mbuk -km lindoman -e CONVERT_TO=elite_pi -bl uf2-split-right
